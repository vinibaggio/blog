In this part of the [Road to Sourdough Bread guide](http://localhost:8000/food/bread/part-1-intro-to-series/), I will use [Jim Lahey's No-Knead bread](https://www.markbittman.com/recipes-1/no-knead-bread) recipe. As the name of the recipe says, it doesn't require kneading. It also doesn't use anything besides flour, salt, yeast and water. As all the loaves in this guide, it uses time to develop gluten and flavor.

Before starting baking sourdough loaves, we will use this recipe as the MVP of breads so we have the following learning goals:

- Get the hang of your oven and your tools;
- Learn how to handle and shape fermented dough;
- Develop an intuition on each step of the dough.

By using industrialized yeast we trade flavor for consistency, i.e. the bread won't be as flavorful, but barring defects in your yeast, we can guarantee your bread will be fermented by the end of the bulk period. Such guarantees are harder to achieve with natural leaven.

Before starting the recipe, let's talk about the ingredients.

## Flour

Given that we are not adding ingredients such as egg, milk or oil to the loaf, all the flavor of this recipe will come from the flour. Flour is something that price is an indication of quality, so get the most expensive flour you can afford. If your grocery store has locally-grown grains, give preference to that brand, otherwise, I have had a lot of success with King Arthur Flour, which I have found easily in the Bay Area and in NYC, places I have lived. Not only Bob's Red Mill is a great employee-owned company, but they also make excellent flour as well. Finally, you may also use "00" or doppio zero, but they tend to be costly. Note that each brand might use a different type of wheat (want to know more about types of wheat? Let me know!) and it will definitely change the characteristics of the dough. Every flour is different.

Flour contains protein, and its quantity varies according to the flour type. In the United States, they are categorized as cake, pastry, all-purpose (AP), and bread flour. Cake and pastry flours have low percentage of protein so it is not suited for breads. The best choice is bread flour, as you might have guessed, but all-purpose is also suitable. Bread flour has the highest percentage of all, from 14 to 16% of protein, which can turn into more gluten. More gluten development will yield a loaf with crumb structure and better <Term t="Oven Spring" />. It improves not only the appearance but also the flavor.

The contents of a bag of flour can also vary depending on the extraction of the grain of wheat. Whole wheat flour includes both the germ, bran and endosperm. Loaves made using whole wheat flour tend to be denser (i.e., smaller oven spring), since the bran is sharp and can cut the gluten chains, letting air escape. On the other hand, loaves made with whole wheat flour tend to have more complex, nuttier flavor. It is also said to be more nutritious. I prefer loaves that include at least 10% of whole wheat flour, but adding too much whole-wheat flour can dramatically change the loaf, changing its flavor and texture. I recommend getting started with non-whole wheat flour since they are easier to handle. I will include some whole wheat bread recipes in the future, since they need to be adapted (whole wheat flours can soak a lot more water than AP/bread flour).

Finally, there are also different species of wheat that can be used in bread baking, such as emmer/einkorn, farro, spelt and rye. Every species have a different protein content and incur a different change in the final product, such as less gluten but hartier flavor (such as rye), more elastic and a pleasant nutty flavor, such as spelt or emmer. These are great additions to a loaf of bread, but I would only recommend using these flours after you have some experience with bread baking. Since the gluten content can vary quite a bit, it can make a dough much more difficult to handle. Note that buckwheat flour, although delicious, is not made out of a wheat berry and does not include any gluten, so avoid it for now.

## Water

Tap water can have chlorine that can kill the yeast, so I use filtered or mineral water. In the US, I have seen many people using Brita filters which, in my experience, might not be enough to remove the chlorine, as I have experienced myself. My breads were as flat as pancakes when I moved to an apartment in Brooklyn, even with a Brita filter. I replaced it with a bigger, over-the-counter filter and, problem solved! If you think you are running into issues with your fermentation, try boiling water or let the water sit over a few hours–chlorine will evaporate. For this recipe, you can use room temperature water.

## Salt

Even though I prefer to cook with kosher salts such as Diamond Crystal, when baking I like to use finely ground salt so that it dissolves more easily in the dough. No need to get fancy and use your expensive himalayan or breton grey sea salt.

## Yeast

There are many types of yeast that you can buy in the super market:

- Active-Dry Yeast: these are the most common ones you can find in little envelopes in the baking section. These are what we are going to use here. Note that some recipes tell you to "activate" the yeast in warm water and a little sugar. This step is completely unnecessary. Just make sure you don't mix it with salt since the salt can kill the yeast, but you can add it directly to the dry mixture.

- Instant yeast or bread machine yeast: this is pretty much the same as Active-Dry Yeast and if you have one or the other, it is going to work just fine. These usually come in little jars and last a long time, so keep it in your fridge.

- RapidRise Yeast: it looks like this yeast is not the same as the previous two and from my research, it doesn't seem suited for breads and longer fermentations, so please avoid these if you can.

- Fresh yeast: not so common in the US but easy to find in countries like Brazil and Italy, these are a little less robust and you can't forget about it in your fridge. To use it in recipes, double the quantity of yeast (so use 1/2 tsp when the recipe calls for 1/4 tsp. active-dry), crumble it and dissolve in the liquid you are using in your recipe.

# Measuring



# The Recipe, or formula

Here are the ingredients:

Ingredient | Weight | Volume | Baker's percentage [^2]
-----------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------
AP or Bread flour|550g|4 cups|100%
Water|450|2 cups|85%-ish
Salt|12g|2 tsp|5%
Yeast|–|½ tsp|–

> Note: since measuring in volumes and measuring in weight are not necessarily compatible, I have made approximations to the weights. The original recipe is expressed in volumes only, but as we have seen in TK Measuring, I have made convertions to weight here. This is the only recipe in this guide that will use volume measurements, so I recommend getting a kitchen scale if you can.

This recipe requires a bit of

[^1]: Baker's percentage means that each ingredient is expressed as a ratio of the total flour weight. The flour weight will always add up to 100% and the other ingredients will be a proportion of that weight. For instance, if in a formula we use 500g of flour weight, and a formula has water expressed as 75%, the total water used will be 375g, or 75% of 500g. For more information, see [the Wikipedia article on Baker's percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage)
