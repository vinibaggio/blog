## Formula

|Ingredient|Quantity|Baker's percentage
|----------|--------|----
|Bread flour|500g|100%|
|Water|400g|80%|
|100% Cocoa|30g|6%|
|Levain|125g|25%|
|Chocolate chips|75g|15%|
|Dried cranberries|75g|15%|
|Salt|12g|2.4%|

Following the Tartine method, after the second Stretch-and-fold, fold in the chocolate and the cranberry. You can soak the cranberry in hot water if you want but it's not really necessary.
