I spent 6 weeks in Italy between June and July 2018. I just had quit my job and spent most of the time in a tiny village in Tuscany. My main goal was to work on some italian inheritage paperwork, and that had many limitations. The main limitation was that I couldn't travel much during the week, so I mostly had half of Saturday and Sunday to travel.

Given that the italian train system is amazing, I was still able to visit many incredible places, just by train.

To jump to photos of a specific place, click below:

- [Cinque Terre](#cinque-terre)
- [Venice](#venice)
- [Florence](#florence)
- [Lucca](#lucca)
- [Siena](#siena)
- [Collodi](#collodi)
- [Arezzo (Giostra del Saracino)](#arezzo-giostra-del-saracino)
- [Rome](#rome)

## Cinque Terre

First, I went to Cinque Terre, and I hiked from Monterosso al Mare, to Vernazza, to Corniglia and finally to Volastra / Manarola. I was pretty beat by then and I decided to take the train from Manarola to Riomaggiore, given that the easy path is closed until who knows when.

Note: most of the photos are from my phone (Pixel 2), given I smeared my camera lens with sweat and sunscreen. Oops.

## Venice

Here I took more photos with my camera (a Fuji XT-1 with a 35mm prime lens and that's it), but some with my phone too, especially the ones at night.

## Florence

I went multiple days and took a billion of photos of Florence, since I was stationed pretty close to it. Again, mix of Pixel 2 and Fuji XT-1. I tried to pick only the coolest ones here.

## Lucca

Lucca is a beautiful town! I highly recommend it. I didn't take many photos but I highly recommend going there during a festival, or sit at a caf√©, sip some Aperol-Spritz and watch life go by. They have a a lot of Verdi stuff since he was born there.

## Siena

Siena is awesome. Since in the summer italians throw a lot of medieval festivities (pretty sure it's a good tourist business!), I fell into one that I didn't plan. If you go, make sure to check the cathedral. Gorgeous.

## Collodi

Collodi is near the city I was staying, and it's also the home of Pinocchio. I loaded a hiking map I got from wikiloc.com in my GPS watch and followed it. Big mistake -- it didn't have any of the trails, it only told that I had to turn to a certain path. I got lost many times but it was a gorgeous 20km hike! The trail mixed routes that were kept, unkept and also little towns north of Lucca.

## Arezzo (Giostra del Saracino)

I did a super quick stop in Arezzo to checkout the [Giostra del Saracino](http://giostradelsaracinoarezzo.it/en/), a tip that my italian teacher gave me. Most of the tourists there were italians, and there were a ton of local people cheering for their own neighborhoods. It was pretty cool to see that didn't feel artificial. Highly recommended.

## Rome

The last stop was Rome, in which I only spent one day and two nights, beforing returning to New York. I would love to visit Rome again, with more time. So impressive. If you go, check out the tiny concerts everywhere in the summer. I found a piano player playing in a little nook in the jewish neighborhood that was so incredible, even from far away.
